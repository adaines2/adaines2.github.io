                <h1 class="h2">Creative Brief</h1>
                    <p class="p1">Learning how to use the creative brief was my main objective in taking this class, and it has already become incredibly useful to me.</p>
                    <p class="p1"> I work in a startup, so I wear a lot of hats. Recently I had to create a one-pager for a trade show which is not that complicated, but even something as simple as that I built a quick creative brief for my self. It helped me organize my thoughts and think through the other frameworks from class.</p>
                <h1 class="h3">Creative Brief Sections</h1>
                    <h2 class="h3">Objective</h2> 
                        <h3 class="h3">Frameworks:</h3>
                            <p class="p1" style="text-align: center"><strong>4As</strong> <br><br> Awareness <br> &darr; <br> Attitudes <br>&darr;<br> Action <br>&darr;<br> Action Repeated</p>
                            <p class="p1"><strong>Objective-Task Method</strong> <br> Profit = Profit Per Sales X Ad-Related Sales - Advertising Cost </p>
                        <p class="p1">Objectives help focus the strategy. They need to be real and not solely business metrics (e.g., "increase sales"). it's also important that the client maintains ownership of strategy. It's also essential to track the funnel metrics across the 4As so you can adjust your strategy as needed.</p>
                    <h2 class="h3">Target</h2> 
                        <h3 class="h3">Frameworks:</h3>
                            <p class="p1" style="text-align: center">Objectives Targeting <br><br> Usage targets: <br><strong>Category Users:<br></strong> &swarr; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &searr;<br> Branded (Secure) | Competitors (Steal)</p>
                            <p class="p1"><Strong>SPA Tool:</Strong> <Strong>S</Strong>aturation, <Strong>P</Strong>rotection, <Strong>A</Strong>lienation</p>
                        <p class="p1"><strong>Managing Multiple:</strong> Own, Attract, Accept</p>
                        <p class="p1">to effectively use the targeting frameworks you need to have a solid understanding of your market share before deciding which approach is the best. </p>
                    <h2 class="h3">Insight</h2> 
                        <h3 class="h3">Framework:</h3>
                            <p class="p1"><strong>Consumer Insight:</strong> Target &larr; Insight &rarr; Position</p>
                            <p class="p1"><strong>Human Motivations:</strong>  <br>Gratification <br> Agency <br> Communion</p>
                            <p class="p1">Consumer insights rely on your ability to connect consumer behavior to your product. Insight is the glue between our target and position, and it is very difficult to effectively target more than one group at a time. <br><br> Focusing on a given customer motivation and linking that with your branding and marketing can turn an underperforming product into a winner</p>
                    <h2 class="h3">Position</h2> 
                        <h3 class="h3">Frameworks:</h3>
                            <p class="p1"><strong>Positioning Trapezoid</strong></p>
                            <p class="p1" style="text-align: center">Category <br> (Frame of Reference) <br>Points of Similarity &swarr; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &searr;Points of Similarity <br> Your Brand <----Points of Difference---->Competitors Brand</p>
                            <p class="p1"><strong>Laddering</strong> <br>Higher Order Value <br>Emotional Benefit<br> Functional Benefit<br>Featers</p>
                            <p class="p1"><strong>D.O.N.E </strong> | Benefit Desired? &rarr; Position can be Owned? &rarr; Navigate to brand Promise? &rarr; Will the Position Endure?</p>
                        <p class="p1">Frame of reference can help positioning by highlighting different benefits that might not be seen by using a "default" frame of reference (or the obvious choice).<br><br> Changing your frame of reference can also help expand to a new target that might not have been a key customer before under the old Frame of Reference.</p>
                        <p class="p1">Laddering approach is helpful for multi-prong advertising approaches.</p>
                        <p class="p1">Repositioning is problematic and should only be done as a last resort (basically). Your product positioning should impact the 4Ps as well, so it really should impact most aspects of the company.</p>
                    <h2 class="h3">Execution</h2>
                        <h3 class="h3">Frameworks:</h3>
                            <p class="p1">MEEC (Media Efficiency Effectiveness Cost)</p>
                            <p class="p1"> Consumer Journey <br> Pre-need &rarr; Trigger &rarr; Consider &rarr; Buy &rarr; Use &rarr; Post-evaluation/Pre-need</p>
                        <p class="p1">The timing of ads is a key strategic decision (when to push your ads out).
                        <br><br>There are a few different strategies:<br>
                        Pulse - going hard for a period and then taking a break - reduces burnout <br>
                        Ramp - used to gain awareness over time - can be seasonal in nature 
                        <br>Frequency and reach need to be evaluated.<br>
                        <br>Planned decisions work better with reach (oddly - in my opinion).
                        <br>Digital is not a strategy, but digital media is important.</p>
                    <h2 class="h3">Evaluation</h2> 
                        <h3 class="h3">Frameworks:</h3>
                            <p class="p1"><strong>ADPLAN</strong> <br>Attention<br>Distinction <br> Positioning <br>Linkage<br>Amplification<br>Net Equity</p>
                        <p class="p1">Estimating the effectiveness of ads before is a solid way to better understand the best strategy and forces you to really think through the options in more realistic ways.</p>
